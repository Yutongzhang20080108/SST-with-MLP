This is only a brief try to use what I have learnt in Deep Learning and NLP. 
If you guys want to do the same thing you can just download the dataset and the config fils for the pretrained BERT language model.
Please remember that you put the three config files into one dict and send it into the sentence AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(location) as a whole.
Thank you!!!
